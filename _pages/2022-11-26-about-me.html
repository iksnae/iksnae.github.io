<p>during the day i architect and develop software solutions. in my free time i can be found engaged in a number of creative outlets: <a href="https://iksnae.com/category/illustration/" data-type="category" data-id="4">drawing</a>, <a href="https://iksnae.com/category/animation/" data-type="category" data-id="7">animating</a>, cooking, woodworking, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0v5CmvASL3FTz" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0v5CmvASL3FTz" target="_blank">gardening</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://soundcloud.com/iksnae" data-type="URL" data-id="https://soundcloud.com/iksnae" target="_blank">making beats </a>or whatever feels right at the moment.  </p>

<p>my career in software started around 1998 when i started programmatically drawing and animating in ( then Macromedia) Flash to build websites and other interactive experiences. around the same time i was also doing a lot of video production: shooting, editing, motion graphics and such, but coding was becoming more and more attractive as i was able to do many of the things i'd done in video in realtime. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>over the following 10 years, i shifted to completely to development, working as a Flash Developer at a wide number of ad agencies in NYC. </p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>in 2011 (amidst the Steve Jobs vs Adobe battle) i'll make the switch from Flash (ActionScript) to iOS (Objective-C) and started building mobile apps and games. this year also i'll accept my first role as an iOS Developer where lead development of Martha Stewarts Crafts for iPad. </p>

<p>in 2012 i joined a kickass iOS enterprise dev shop, where i honed my skills and shaped many of my views as a developer to this day. here we produced some amazing software at impeccable quality. i was fortunate to work closely with software masters. additionally, working in a co-working / incubator space, i was exposed directly to the day-to-day of building startups. i'll also attend my first WWDC where I was fortunately to be introduced to Eddie Cue after the keynote. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>over the next 10 years i'll work as a contract iOS developer and even co-found a few companies, holding the role of CTO and Sole-Coder, responsible for building numerous mobile apps and supporting services. the technical challenges lead to me embracing AWS and cloud development.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Since then i've continued to develop software, focused on quality architectures and code quality. In recent years, I've felt a yearning to return to creative work, so i've started drawing and animating more and more in my free time, aspiring to build <a href="https://khaos.studio" data-type="URL" data-id="https://khaos.studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my own animation studio</a></p>
