<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>so i had an idea to challenge my creativity by using a random name generator to act as a description.. one of the names that came up was "Wormtu Sockball" .. initially i thought of Earthworm Jim crawling out of a sock.. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>i didn't want to spend a lot of time on the project, so i wanted to limit it to a session.. the goal is practice more so than creating a final or polished piece. here's the result:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:video {"id":408} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay controls loop muted src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2022/11/Untitled_Artwork-1.mp4" playsinline></video></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:video --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>i didn't complete the concept and kinda went down a rabbit hole with coloring/shading... i'm not disappointed though. it was fun and i intend to repeat this practice.</p>
