after assuming the role of employee for X years, i for the first time in a very long time find myself unemployed, yet not concerned. a confidence i can't say that i've felt in a very long time.

no. i'm not rich or anywhere near in a position to retire. nor am i ready to retire. i still have a lot more fire in me. the change is this is the first time in a while that i've bet on myself. 
frightening as it may be, it's also very exilerating to feel in control of my own destiny
