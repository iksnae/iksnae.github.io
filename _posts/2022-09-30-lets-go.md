### Hey Kids (Bumaye) - Lyrics

##### Killer Mike

```
Hey, hey k-
Hey kids!

(This is so crazy!)

Say hello to the masters, on behalf of the classless masses
We showed up, ski masks, picks, and axes to murder asses
Lift up our glasses and watch your palaces burn to ashes
Fucking fascists, who the fuck are you to give fifty lashes
All cause I'm motivated, stimulated, never smoking simulated happy and burning hashes
Killer, killer, dealing with him like he's a squealer
Get 'em, got 'em, shout 'em, and flipped the matress
Woo! I'm the man bitch, got big ideas, got plans to rob
Any Rothschild living, Bill Gates and the ghost of Jobs
Yeah I said it, I meant it, I ain't flinchin, Marshawn Lynchin' it
Run through a motherfucker's face like ig'nant, isn't it
Domain eminent, we the preeminant
Villainous willingness, spitting this ready raw rap shit rhyme ridiculous
Enemy grave he digging it, then we piss in it
Us go to hell, we been in it, gettin' it, yeah

Bumaye, yeah
```

#### LP

```
Aye, aye kids

I'm the fucking tits, I hold no regard for no fucking myths, hey
I lived half my life to give half my cash to these half man imps
They got half a heart, they give half a fuck, they got half the guns
I got half an hour, I'll burn half a pound and I have to run
Killers of the earth get scared
You do not get one word
You do not live for the heard
Even you living's absurd, better off kicked to the curb
That is my word
Back in the Berenstein timeline zip, no wins for the kid oh shit I got curved
In the Berenstain riff, I'm a Biff, so sick when the clock is lit, the whip swerve
It's like nothin' not broke, can't stand the scope in the booth
I disrobe like pederast pope on a play-date
Better call mayday, baby I'll spray, I'm an AK
They flayed and plated, I'm serving dead meat fame to table
Cain to Abel, death's apprentice
Run the Jewels'll make last breaths Brexit

Bumaye
