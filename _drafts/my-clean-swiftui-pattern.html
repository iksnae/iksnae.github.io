<p>after building several production apps using SwiftUI, i've landed on a pattern which i think aligns with the goals of a Clean Architecture. it's based on the VIP pattern + Xcode Templates by XX originally designed for use with UIKit.  since there were no established Clean SwiftUI patterns, i started to iterate on a solution. </p>

<p>one of my favorite things about the Clean Swift/VIP solution was that from a project/folder structure it was dead simple. Structuring things around the "Scene" provides clean encapsulation</p>
