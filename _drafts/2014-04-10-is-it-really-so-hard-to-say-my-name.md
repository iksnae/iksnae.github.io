Is it really so hard to pronounce my name? I guess so, because at least 95% of the time my name is butchered and it’s always an effort to correct this error. I think that some people already have it in their head how it’s pronounced. I understand that it’s not the most common name and do not expect everyone to get it the first try, especially if they haven’t heard it before.

When I find myself mildly irked is when I introduce myself, only to hear it regurgitated in a form that vaguely resembles what i just said. To help remedy this, I’ve tried to come up with ways to help those that may find themselves challenged, without embarrassing or putting them on the spot.

Occasionally I meet people (usually those with names that also get mispronounced) who make an effort asking me "how I" pronounce my name. To simplify things I tell them it’s pronounced like Collin, with a “d” instead of an “n”. This works most of the time. Then on the rare occasion I meet someone who know’s how it’s really pronounced. Not how I pronounce it, but the real arabic pronunciation. While I don’t typically say it this way myself, it’s far more welcome. It’s like a breath of fresh air. I appreciate it so much, that I make it a point to thank those who say it correct or at least ask me.

It’s guaranteed that 9 out of 10 people will make the “i” long “e”, converting it to something more like Ku • lead, or put too much emphasis on the first syllable making it start like California or a combination of the two. Maybe I’m being sensitive, but I think that pronouncing someone’s name correctly is important. Is there anyone else who has experienced this (on either side)? What are your thoughts on it?

I found this youtube video that demonstrates the correct way to pronounce my name [http://bit.ly/1qxfJRv](http://bit.ly/1qxfJRv) I don’t expect anyone to go this far as it can be challenging, but I hope they atleast care enough to try to say it how I say it when I introduce myself.
